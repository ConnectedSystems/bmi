The Basic Model Interface
=========================

Development of scientific modeling software increasingly requires
the coupling of multiple, independently developed models.
Component-based software engineering enables the integration of
plug-and-play components, but significant additional challenges
must be addressed in any specific domain in order to produce a
usable development and simulation environment that also encourages
contributions and adoption by entire communities. In this paper we
describe the challenges in creating a coupling environment for
Earth-surface process modeling and the innovative approach that
we have developed to address them within the Community Surface
Dynamics Modeling System.
